# botwmoddingserver
Mods and resources for the BOTW modding server

## Mods
The mods used can be found within the download itself, within the modlist.html file.

The pack is available on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nopyros-botwmodding-modpack). IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE PACK FROM CURSEFORGE YOU MUST ADD [kibe CUSTOMMUSTDOWNLOADFROMHERE.jar](https://github.com/NoPyro/botwmoddingserver/raw/main/kibe%20CUSTOMMUSTDOWNLOADFROMHERE.jar) MANUALLY TO JOIN THE SERVER.

There is also a [.zip file](https://mega.nz/file/jfZ3lQLK#u2vDjPATF3Adv9WvxgtcYuOG1x26gWwgqwFMfEoZXxA) containing all the mods for manual installation.



## Recommended Clientside Mods
Certain clientside mods (the server doesn't need them, only you) have been omitted from the pack, due to believing their addition may not be preferred by everyone, as such we have decided to list them here:
-[Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica) (needs [MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib))
-[ToroHealth](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/torohealth-damage-indicators)
-[Iris Starline](https://github.com/HyperCubeMC/Iris)
