# botwmoddingserver
Mods and resources for the BOTW modding server

## Mods
The mods used can be found within the download itself, within the modlist.html file

## Recommended Clientside Mods
Certain clientside mods (the server doesn't need them, only you) have been omitted from the pack, due to believing their addition may not be preferred by everyone, as such we have decided to list them here:
-[Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica) (needs [MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib))
-[ToroHealth](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/torohealth-damage-indicators)
-[Iris Starline](https://github.com/HyperCubeMC/Iris)
